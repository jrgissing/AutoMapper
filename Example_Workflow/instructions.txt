This folder is an example of phenolic resin polymerisation. A bond forms between the carbon of one phenol molecule to another phenol molecule by an already bound formaldehyde molecule to produce water as a byproduct, which gets deleted. For more details on this reaction, see my earlier work on the topic https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4360/12/4/926.

Commands to generate an 'automap.data' file and pre- and post-bond molecule files are as follows:

Clean the data files and system.in.settings coefficient file - these files have been created using Moltemplate.
	AutoMapper.py . clean pre_reaction.data post_reaction.data --coeff_file system.in.settings

Create the map and molecule files
	AutoMapper.py . map cleanedpre_reaction.data cleanedpost_reaction.data --save_name pre-molecule.data post-molecule.data --ba 4 19 4 19 --da 13 10 25 29 10 30 --ebt H H C C O O

The order of files for the map should always be "pre-bond post-bond".
The bonding atom order represents the same atoms in each file i.e. the 4 is the reacting formaldehyde carbon and 19 is the reacting phenol carbon. The order of the atoms should always be the same. The numbers can be different between the pre- and post-bond files
The delete atoms work in the same way as the bonding atoms. There are three delete atoms from the pre-bond and three from the post-bond and pair as such 13/29, 10/10, 25/30.
See phenolic_resin.png to see how the cleanedpre_reaction.data and cleanedpost_reaction.data Atom IDs map onto the final partial structure.

Run the LAMMPS code
	lmp -in run.bond

You should see the 0 turn to a 1 next to the step count in the thermo output. In my test of this it happened at 15000 steps
